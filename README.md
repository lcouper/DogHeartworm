## Currently working on ##

Q2: GBM identifying which climate / land cover predictors are important for each species

## Next to do ##

- figure out why model is R squared so low? is model that bad? 
- Caroline's suggestion of calculating confidence intervals for the feature importance by running model 100 times. 
-  Goal = to identify what feature importance cutoffs to use when determining if variable is biologically "important"
- look into metrics used by Nick Skaff  & Van Buren: change in Gini impurity criterion, 'gain' (Van Buren) & overall predictor error
- how to calculate marginal effects / partial dependence plots (new package: https://github.com/bgreenwell/pdp)
- How to calculate prediction error!!! 
- Underestand differences between testing and cross validation sets (see Van Buren paper)?
