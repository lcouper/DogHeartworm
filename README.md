### Currently working on ###
Q2: GBM identifying which climate / land cover predictors are important for each species

### Next to do ###

"*" figure out why model is R squared so low? is model that bad? 

Caroline's suggestion of calculating confidence intervals for the feature importance by running model 100 times
Goal = to identify what feature importance cutoffs to use when determining if variable is biologically "important"

# look into metrics used by Nick Skaff  & Van Buren:
# change in Gini impurity criterion, 'gain' (Van Buren) & overall predictor error
# how to calculate marginal effects 
# how to create partial dependence plots (new package: https://github.com/bgreenwell/pdp)
# How to calculate prediction error!!!
# see Van Buren paper? 
# difference between testing and cross validation sets!
