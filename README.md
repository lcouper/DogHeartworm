## Currently working on ##

Q2: GBM identifying which climate / land cover predictors are important for each species

## Just done ##

- One-hot encoding now working
- Bayesian optimizaiton now working 

## Next to do ##

- Log transform really skewed variables to reduce influence of extreme outliers on model performance? 
- Increase nrounds of Bayesian optimization 
- Set up scripts and run on Sherlock or SCG
- Set up bootstrapping
- Figure out how to create partial dependence plots 
- Figure out: what is the difference between marginal effects and partial dependence?
- Figure out: is "out of sample" prediction error the same as test error? (i.e., from when applying model from training data to test data)
