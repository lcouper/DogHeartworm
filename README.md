## Currently working on ##

Q2: GBM identifying which climate / land cover predictors are important for each species

## Next to do ##

- Check if one-hot encoding actually working
- Look into model evaluation metrics e.g., change in Gini impurity criterion, 'gain', overall predictor error
- Figure out how to calculate OOB predictor error 
- Figure out how to calculate marginal effects / partial dependence plots (new package: https://github.com/bgreenwell/pdp)
